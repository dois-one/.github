# DOIS

**Two engineers. One mission: say what we actually believe.**

DOIS (Portuguese for "two") is a content platform sharing honest, unfiltered perspectives on AI, software engineering, and the craft of building things that work.

## Who We Are

### Thiago
**Enterprise Systems Architect** — Navigates complexity and politics at scale. Director of Architecture at Planet Payments, working across payments, hospitality, retail, and data. Focuses on high-stakes decisions where the blast radius is large.

*Writing style: Provocative, direct, systems-thinking. Surfaces uncomfortable truths others dance around.*

### Andreos  
**Startup Builder & Product Leader** — Built products from zero, moved fast through startup chaos. Draws lessons from psychology, economics, and game theory to understand problems deeply.

*Writing style: Direct but humble, authentic, curious. Shares failures openly and invites dialogue.*

## What We Write About

*This isn't for everyone. If you want validation, look elsewhere. If you want us to hedge every opinion with "it depends" — we'll disappoint you. What we will do: share what we've learned, experiment in the open, and say it straight.*
